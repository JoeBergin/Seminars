This is even true if the question is about the seminar content you as the teacher should know. But nobody is perfect. If you try to seem perfect, nobody will believe it. Tell the participants freely that you do not know the answer. Tell them that you'll look it up for them, or explicitly ask the fellow participants whether one of them can answer the question. You can also try to work out the solution together with the participants. Be sure not to create the impression that the question is overly difficult, and that everybody who tries to answer it cannot possibly know it because you, the teacher do not know it. Otherwise, nobody will answer such questions!\n  ",
