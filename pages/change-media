However, be sure not to create a \"media battle\" using every possible medium in every session. By changing the media in the course of a seminar, the sessions are more diversified.\n  ",

A beamer can be used together with the suitable animation software to illustrate a process. Of course it can be used as a replacement for transparencies by using a presentation software such as MS PowerPoint.\n  ",
