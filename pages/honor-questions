This is unfortunate because questions show that the participants think about a topic. A question can also give a good hint on the problems the participants might still have with a new topic. Or questions can lead the seminar into a direction that is not part of the <i>[[SEMINAR PLAN]]</i> but important for the participants (which is a way to <i>[[ADAPT TO THE PARTICIPANTS BACKGROUND]]</i>).\n  ",
