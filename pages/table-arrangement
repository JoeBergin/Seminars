This arrangement has the additional advantage that you can easily walk to every participant. A last point is, that it is not possible for some participants to sit in the last row, or: those who arrive last do not have to sit in the unpopular first row. The U-Form has the disadvantage that it wastes a lot of space.\n  ",
