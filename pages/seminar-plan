You might not realize the problems the participants might have because you deal with the contents all the time and know them by heart. Often, this results in an unstructured approach to the content which is hard for the participants to follow. You should not believe that talking a lot compensates for an unstructured approach, because you might not distinguish between important and not so important topics. In addition, you will not want to say things like\"Oh, I forgot to say when we were talking about XY....\".\n  ",

Try to create plans on different abstraction levels, a high-level plan for the complete seminar and detailed plans for each topic. The plans should highlight important topics and define goals you want the participants to reach.\n  ",

Doing this regularly means that you can adapt it in a sensible way and not just skip the last chapter, because you run out of time.\n  ",
