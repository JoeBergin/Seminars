To make this possible, a harmonious group, a \"team\", must be built up, especially if the group works together for a longer period of time and they did not know each other before the seminar. Such group-building processes should be explicitly assisted at the beginning of a seminar. An atmosphere of trust must be created among the participants to allow effective learning.

However, games can be dangerous if the participants do not like them or consider them childish or otherwise useless. Never use games if the participants do not want it.\n  ",
