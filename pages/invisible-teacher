The participants are passive, copy the contents, do not ask questions; they do not try to follow you in your thinking. Learning is most effective if the learners works on their own. Otherwise, the participants start to feel bored, motivation is low and the participants start to do other things. In the worst case, they leave the sessions and get coffee.\n  ",

The best teaching method is not to teach at all, but to let the participants work on the content on their own. You should offer the participants help whenever they have problems. Sometimes teacher presentations are necessary, but you should keep the \"show\" part of your sessions to a minimum. Use different <i>[[WORK FORMS]]</i> to achieve this.\n  ",

This \"show off\" problem is especially critical with very skilled teachers, or  gurus. A guru in a certain domain is not necessarily the best teacher, there is more to good teaching than good domain knowledge.\n  ",
