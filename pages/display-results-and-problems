As a consequence, participants will be able to recognize what the group has achieved, and which points are still open. Questions do not have to be asked again and again, and the participants can see that the questions are not forgotten. It can also serve as a <i>[[SUMMARY]]</i> or as a way to <i>[[REPEAT TOPICS]]</i>. Using this pattern can also help to build a <i>[[COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT]]</i>.\n  ",
