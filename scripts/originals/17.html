  <p class=patHeading>17. GAMES *</p>

  <P class=patProblem>
  You realize that it is important to have <A href="14.html">PERSONAL COMMUNICATION</A>. To make this possible, a harmonious group, a "team", must be built up, especially if the group works together for a longer period of time and they did not know each other before the seminar. Such group-building processes should be explicitly assisted at the beginning of a seminar. An atmosphere of trust must be created among the participants to allow effective learning. This is part of a <A href="4.html">COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT</A>.

  <P class=patSolution>
  Therefore, consider playing games in the group. The games should emphasize achieving things together. Games that aim at distinguishing winners and losers are not suitable. The games should leave enough room for <A href="14.html">PERSONAL COMMUNICATION</A>. Games improve group quality, and they are usually not very demanding, from an intellectual point of view, serving as a good way to relax. However, games can be dangerous if the participants do not like them or consider them childish or otherwise useless. Never use games if the participants do not want it.

  <P class=patExample>
  The positive effects of playing games in a group can be observed at the EuroPLOP conferences. A special person (George) is there to organize and coordinate games. Real, mature people play them, and this is one of the reasons why the EuroPLOP is so special. It is reported that games are also successfully used in some management seminars.
