By connecting these patterns with common forces and other relations he transforms this collection of patterns to a pattern language.

The movement started in universities and at the major programming conferences, such as OOPSLA. The first book that was publicly available was \"Design Patterns\" by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and  Glissades called the Gang of Four (GoF). It was published in 1994, and they presented a catalog of 23 patterns on how to design software systems. In the meantime, domain specific patterns and pattern languages have been created, and the pattern movement has its own set of conferences, namely the PLOP, EuroPLOP, ChiliPLOP and KoalaPLOP (PLOP stands for Pattern Languages of Programs). Many of the patterns presented at these conferences can be found via PLOP1-4 at <i>[[Resources]]</i>\n  ",
