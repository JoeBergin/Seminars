  <p class=patHeading>21. WORK FORMS *</p>

  <P class=patProblem>
  Usually, the presentation style is used for the majority of the topics although this style is often not suitable. Usually, it is used because it is not too much work to prepare, and because it can be planned easily. It is a mistake to believe that the participants learn a lot just because you cover a lot of knowledge in a short time.

  Therefore, try to use other work forms. There are many alternatives to the traditional presentations style. Learning works much better, if the participants are actively involved! Be sure to adapt the work form to topic taught. Of course, there are other forces when you decide which work form is best, such as time and space requirements, and the motivation of the participants.

  <P class=patSolution>
  If presentation is necessary, be sure to alternate the presentation phases (where the participants are passive) and the work phases (where the participants are active).

  There are several ways how to involve the participants into the seminar. The most commonly used forms are:
  group work, partner work, working alone, and discussions involving all participants.
  <P class=patSolution>
  Especially for exercises, group and partner work is interesting and often more effective than working alone. It has the additional advantage of improving the cooperation among members of the group. You should ideally try to alternate the different work forms. If you do that,  then there is also space for presentation style phases.

  <P class=patExample>
  You can let the participants work out solutions to problems on their own. Be sure that the majority of the participants will find the intended solution, otherwise they will get frustrated. You should be available to help, answer questions and provide material for the participants to use.

  <P class=patExample>
  Letting the participants explain a topics to a fellow participant can also be a very effective way of learning.

  <P class=patExample>
  The presentation style should only be used if you intend to transport a lot of information in a short time. The emphasis is on information: Only use it for fact-style information. Do not use it for topics that have to be understood by the participants or for building up skill. Be sure not to get blinded by colorful, animated presentations that can be created with today's tools. They are a lot better than plain talking, but the participants are still passive!
