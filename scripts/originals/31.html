  <p class=patHeading>31. GENERAL CONCEPTS FIRST **</p>

  <P class=patProblem>
  The brain learns best if it can associate new topics with already learned topics. The more associations the brain can create for a new topic, the better it remembers it. The brain can store new knowledge more easily if has "categories" in which to store new knowledge.

  <P class=patSolution>
  Therefore, teach general concepts first. When teaching details, or other topics that are based on the general topics taught before, this has two positive consequences: The new topic can be remembered more easily, because it can be associated with the general concepts. And the general concepts are stored more thoroughly, because they become <A href="33.html">REPEATED TOPICS</A>  as new topics are introduced.
  </P>
  <P class=patExample>
  For example, teach the concepts of defining logical interfaces first. Explain the advantages of pure interface definitions. Then introduce pure abstract classes (C++, Java) and interfaces (Java ,IDL) and show how they implement the general concept of an interface.
