  <p class=patHeading>33. REPEAT TOPICS *</p>

  <P class=patProblem>
  There are some biological preconditions for effective learning. The brain can remember things easier, if it can connect new topics to old ones, and it considers those topics important, that it comes across repeatedly. The transfer of knowledge from the short-term memory into the long-term memory happens easier after a couple of repetitions.

  <P class=patSolution>
  Therefore, repeat important topics. Create cross links among topics to allow the participants to connect new topics to older ones. Be sure to repeat only important topics, and not more or less unimportant details. Otherwise, the participants' brains will interpret a repetition as "this is important". Using older facts as a basis for new things is also a means of repeating topics, this is facilitated by teaching <A href="31.html">GENERAL CONCEPTS FIRST</A>. Additional repetitions are of course provided by a <A href="10.html">REVIEW AFTER BREAKS</A>, or by recalling them in a <A href="11.html">SUMMARY</A> session.

  <P class=patExample>
  There are different ways how things can be repeated. For example, exercises can be used. Or you could let the participants discuss and relate the three most important topics.
