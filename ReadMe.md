Here we reformat HTML from a web site to JSON and publish it as an instance of the Smallest Federated Wiki.

You will want to look at the structure of the `convert.rb` script.
It consists of helper functions that create fragments of JSON for various paragraph types.
It includes Nokogiri parsing and queries that reads one specific document.
This will only suggest how you might crack the style codes used should you have a similar need.

The first wiki was built for sharing and enlarging a body of patterns.
This little wiki contains th heart of the Seminars pattern language from Markus Voelter and Astrid Fricke. Seminars gives advice to instructors who must conduce short teaching/training seminars. 
Federation, enabled by CC licensing, was the missing element of the first pattern wiki.
