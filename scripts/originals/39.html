  <p class=patHeading>39. TEACHER'S LANGUAGE *</p>

  <P class=patProblem>
  In addition to the technical contents, one of the most important aspects of good teaching is the medium with which the contents are primarily transported - namely your language. Your speech should be easily understandable for all participants.

  <P class=patSolution>
  Therefore, you should use a language that suits the participants, being expressive and fascinating at the same time. Your voice should resemble the suspense that should prevail in the participants. You should speak loud enough that in can be heard in the whole room. If you run a lot of seminars and you experience problems with your voice you should consider training you voice, control your breathing and ensure proper posture.
  </P>
  <P class=patExample>
  Use short, simple sentences. Technical termini should only be used if they are well known. Use a verbal style. Speak slowly and insert breaks to give the listeners a chance to process complicated facts. Accentuate important topics by changing your voice, by varying your talking rate or by repeating them. Speak loud enough and do not use too much dialect.
  </P>
  <P class=patExample>
  If non-native speakers are among the participants, you should slow down your speech to ensure that everybody can follow.
