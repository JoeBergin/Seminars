  <p class=patHeading>20. DIFFERENT APPROACHES **</p>

  <P class=patProblem>
  Every person has different channels through which he or she can obtain knowledge most effectively. Some learn by reading, others by listening or working with their hands or even by explaining a topic to somebody else. Some people need a graphical representation of the topic to learn effectively, or they even have to create a sketch on their own. Do not be fooled by yourself: Not every participant learns most effectively in the same way as you do!

  <P class=patSolution>
  Therefore, provide different approaches to the same topic. You should try to give every participant a chance to learn using the most effective channel. If it is not possible to provide different approaches for a single topic, then at least use different approaches for different topics, so that each participant has the chance to learn something. Using different <A href="21.html">WORK FORMS</A> can help here.

  <P class=patExample>
  An average human being takes up over 83% of the overall knowledge with the eyes. So be sure to visualize important topics.

  <P class=patExample>
  It is also a good idea to use a combination of several channels, e.g. when explaining something verbally, you could show transparencies in addition. For the visualization of important topics, you can use transparencies, posters, models... You could let the participants draw a diagram that sums up your explanations.
