All patterns are written in the you-form, thus directly talking to you, the teacher. In addition to the pattern name, each pattern is divided into three sections. The first section describes the problem and the forces. The second section (below the diamonds) outlines the solution to the described problem as well as the consequences, limitations, and disadvantages. The third section provides examples and additional information on implementing the pattern. References to other patterns in this language are printed in CAPITAL LETTERS.\n  ",

For patterns with no asterisk we are sure that there are other, perhaps better ways of solving the problem, but we have not yet found them.\n  ",
