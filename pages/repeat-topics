Be sure to repeat only important topics, and not more or less unimportant details. Otherwise, the participants' brains will interpret a repetition as \"this is important\". Using older facts as a basis for new things is also a means of repeating topics, this is facilitated by teaching <i>[[GENERAL CONCEPTS FIRST]]</i>. Additional repetitions are of course provided by a <i>[[REVIEW AFTER BREAKS]]</i>, or by recalling them in a <i>[[SUMMARY]]</i> session.\n  ",
