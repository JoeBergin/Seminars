  <p class=patHeading>23. LET THE PLAN GO *</p>

  <P class=patProblem>
  You have a <A href="5.html">SEMINAR PLAN</A> and you try to stick to it. This can create a kind of inflexibility. At sometime during the sessions, the need will arise, to do something unplanned because a participant asks a question that is not really part of your plan. You have enough BUFFERS, so there is no temporary constraints.
  </P>

  <P class=patSolution>
  Therefore, let the plan go. Diverge from the plan and improvise the parts that are necessary to cover the unplanned topic. This is a good way to <A href="2.html">ADAPT TO PARTICIPANTS BACKGROUND</A>. It is important to have a <A href="5.html">SEMINAR PLAN</A>, to be able to return to that plan after you have finished the unplanned topic. Thus, the insertion of an unplanned topic will not result in chaos.
  </P>
  <P class=patExample>
  You could either insert the topic "in-line" and answer it immediately. Then it is good to choose another presentation medium, e.g. the flipchart if you use transparencies for the planned topics.
  </P>
  <P class=patExample>
  You could also postpone the unplanned topic until you have finished with a reasonable section of the plan. To make sure that the topic is not forgotten, it might make sense to add the unplanned topic to the overview or to the <A href="25.html">RESULTS AND PROBLEMS</A>.
