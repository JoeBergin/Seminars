  <p class=patHeading>14. PERSONAL COMMUNICATION **</p>

  <P class=patProblem>
  In addition to creating a physically <A href="4.html">COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT</A>, it is also important that people feel well from a social point of view. They need to talk to each other informally. This is especially true if they work in the same domain and come from different companies, because they will want to talk shop with each other. If you do not give them the time explicitly, they will do it during the sessions. It is also very important that there are times where the distinction between you and the participants becomes less important. Informal talking is also necessary to build up a harmonious group.

  Therefore, make sure that the participants have time to talk! Create spare times where all participants are together in an informal setting. These spare times should not be filled with seminar content. It is important that you are also present during these spare times, but not playing the teacher's role, you should be "on the same level" as the participants. Avoid doing other things during this time, such as organizing the next sessions or making additional copies. Also try to avoid talking about the seminar or about topics from the seminar.

  Personal Communication can help to solve problems among the participants or between you and participants. To facilitate personal communication be sure to use <A href="16.html">NAMEPLATE</A>s. Playing <A href="17.html">GAMES</A> can provide a good environment for talking.

  The group could go to lunch together or visit a pub in the evening. The <A href="4.html">COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT</A> can  offer small tables, where people can stand, drink coffee and talk to each other. This pattern is especially important if you have worked (or work) in the same domain or even company as the participants before you started teaching seminars.
