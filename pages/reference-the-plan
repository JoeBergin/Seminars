If there is not too much content in a seminar, you could add a simplified version of the TOC on each transparency, highlighting the current section. Be sure to use short names for each section, so that they can easily be referenced. REVIEW AFTER BREAKS is also a good way to <i>[[REFERENCE THE PLAN]]</i>.\n  ",
