All patterns are written in the you-form, thus directly talking to you, the teacher. In addition to the pattern name, each pattern is divided into three sections. The first section describes the problem and the forces (bold font). The second section (below the jjj) outlines the solution to the described problem as well as the consequences, limitations, and disadvantages. The third section provides examples and additional information (italic font) on implementing the pattern. References to other patterns in this language are printed in CAPITAL LETTERS.\n  ",

For patterns with no asterisk we are sure that there are other, perhaps better ways of solving the problem, but we have not yet found them.\n  ",
