It is also well suited for discussions and collaborative work, because everybody can look everybody in the eye (including you, the teacher). This arrangement has the additional advantage that you can easily walk to every participant. A last point is, that it is not possible for some participants to sit in the last row, or: those who arrive last do not have to sit in the unpopular first row. The U-Form has the disadvantage that it wastes a lot of space.\n  ",
