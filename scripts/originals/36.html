  <p class=patHeading>36. TEACHER TEAMS *</p>

  <P class=patProblem>
  Teaching is not easy and it can be a lot of work to prepare a good seminar. It is especially hard for a teacher to find out about his personal weak points. It is hard to find problems (and their reasons) in your own sessions. If you are very unproductive with a class, you might not realize what the problems are.

  Therefore, join up in teams with fellow teachers. Working in teams is generally more effective than working alone. The people motivate each other and the team produces much more and better output than each member alone. However, working in teams in the context of teaching requires a common attitude towards methodologies, people, et cetera.

  <P class=patSolution>
  During the execution of a seminar, the team member can help each other to improve the seminar by giving constructive feedback.

    <LI><P class=patExample>You can run seminars with more than one teacher, especially during group work phases. Financial or temporal constraints might be a problem here.
    <LI><P class=patExample>You can occasionally sit into each others sessions and criticize him and talk about his problems after the session, which helps you with <A href="48.html">SEMINAR DEBRIEF</A>. This requires a lot of trust into each other.
