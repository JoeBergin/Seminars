Experiences during such a situation are not considered worth learning and are forgotten by the brain, thus not allowing the animal to override its instincts with possibly fatal thoughts. Mapping this behavior to human behavior means that people have to feel comfortable if they want to learn. This includes their physical environment as well as their social well-being during a seminar.\n  ",

      "text": "Another biological fact you cannot ignore is the way our brain works, in particular how it stores and remembers information. The brain is divided into three sections, receiving information in order. The first stage is the ultra-short term memory. It receives information or stimuli from all organs in the body. It can remember things for 10 to 20 seconds. In the literature (see [FV] in  <i>[[Resources]]</i>) it is often described as a kind of oscillation that abates after 10 to 20 seconds. During this time, the information has to be transported to short term memory, where it can be stored for a couple of hours. The transfer from ultra-short term to short term memory takes place, if the particular piece of information is either repeated, or if it can be associated with other information available in the brain - otherwise the information is irretrievably lost. This way, the ultra-short term memory serves as a filter that reduces the huge amount of information reaching the brain. The third stage is the long term memory. As you know, it can store information forever, some of it unconsciously. Information is transferred to long term memory  if the brain thinks it is worth storing for a long time. Information or techniques that are repeated again and again over a long period of time or can be associated with other information in the long term memory are transferred to this part of the brain. Consequently, repetition and association to other topics is absolutely essential in teaching.\n  ",

Participants should work on a topic on their own or explain the topic to somebody else.
