To make this possible, a harmonious group, a \"team\", must be built up, especially if the group works together for a longer period of time and they did not know each other before the seminar. Such group-building processes should be explicitly assisted at the beginning of a seminar. An atmosphere of trust must be created among the participants to allow effective learning. This is part of a <i>[[COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT]]</i>.\n  ",

However, games can be dangerous if the participants do not like them or consider them childish or otherwise useless. Never use games if the participants do not want it.\n  ",
