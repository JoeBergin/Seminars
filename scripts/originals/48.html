  <p class=patHeading>48. SEMINAR DEBRIEF **</p>

   <p>
   (<b> Checkpoint: Seminar is over.
    </b>
    The seminar is over and it is time to look back.)
	</p>

  <P class=patProblem>
  When a seminar is over, you will have made some good and bad experiences, you will have discovered problems and mistakes on your side. Probably you will have made some positive experiences, too. You do not want to make the same mistakes again, and you will want to repeat the good parts in the upcoming seminars.
  </P>

  <P class=patSolution>
  Therefore, be sure to do some kind of debrief after a seminar. All positive experiences and the obvious mistakes should be captured for reuse or avoidance in future seminars.
  </P>
  <P class=patExample>
  You could either just think about the seminar and capture the content on a piece of paper. It is also a good idea to have a kind of predefined checklist that asks certain key questions. If you use <A href="36.html">TEACHER TEAMS</A>, it is also a good idea to discuss a seminar with a colleague. Of course, <A HREF="43.html">PARTICIPANT'S FEEDBACK FORM</A> can provide valuable input.
