  <p class=patHeading>15. ANONYMOUS MAILBOX </p>

  <P class=patProblem>
  There are people who are not able to solve problems by <A href="14.html">PERSONAL COMMUNICATION</A> with other participants or you, the teacher. You should still give these people a chance to communicate their concerns. And sometimes, real problems have risen in the group that cannot be solved just by talking while having a cup of coffee.
  </P>

  <P class=patSolution>
  Therefore, create an official way for participants to communicate to you anonymously. Important information might be communicated to you via this path that would otherwise not reach you at all. If the group works well, <A HREF="14.html">PERSONAL COMMUNICATION</A> will suffice to solve problems. If this pattern gets used heavily, this indicates that there are serious problems within the group or in the relationship participants/teacher.
  </P>
  <P class=patExample>
  An example for this pattern might be a real mailbox somewhere in the class room where participants can put notes. Email and web technology offers other possibilities, of course. At the end of the seminar, offer feedback forms that can be filled by the participants anonymously. Of course, if the groups works well, <A HREF="14.html">PERSONAL COMMUNICATION</A> can help to avoid problems that make this pattern necessary.
