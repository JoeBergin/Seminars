This session should be held in an informal context, which can be achieved by using a suitable <i>[[TABLE ARRANGEMENT]]</i>. It is also possible to use <i>[[GAMES]]</i> at the beginning of such a session. To make a start, you should begin the session by introducing yourself.

The most common form is that everybody introduces himself to the others, including his name, employer, his field of activity, et cetera. In general, the contents depend heavily on the clientele (imaging the difference between programmers and pedagogists). It is a good idea to let the participants decide what they want to include in their introduction. An alternative form is to let one person interview another person and introduce this other person to the group. The introduction session usually ends with everybody attaching a <i>[[NAMEPLATE]]</i> to himself.\n  ",
