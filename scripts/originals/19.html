  <p class=patHeading>19. BE THERE FIRST *</p>

  <P class=patProblem>
  It does not make a very good impression if you drop into the classroom two minutes after the session should have begun, and quickly prepare your  "show" while saying hello to the participants. There is no time for <A href="14.html">PERSONAL COMMUNICATION</A> between you and the participants.
  </P>

  <P class=patSolution>
  Therefore, be there well before the participants arrive. This gives you time to <A href="18.html">PREPARE THE EQUIPMENT</A> and <A href="12.html">WELCOME THE PARTICIPANTS</A> as they arrive. The participants have the impression that you consider the seminar important. When the participants arrive, they have time for <A href="14.html">PERSONAL COMMUNICATION</A> among each other and with you.
  </P>
  <P class=patExample>
  You should prepare all necessary materials, prepare all the necessary transparencies in the correct order, clean the blackboard, et cetera. Be sure to use this pattern in conjunction with <A href="18.html">PREPARE EQUIPMENT</A>.
