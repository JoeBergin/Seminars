  <p class=patHeading>10. REVIEW AFTER BREAKS **</p>

  <P class=patProblem>
  <A HREF="8.html">BREAKS</A> serve as a way to relax and to have <A href="14.html">PERSONAL COMMUNICATION</A>. However, the participants tend to forget things that have been taught before the break, because the topics have not yet been stored in the long-term memory. In addition, you need to give the participants a chance to make connections from the topics before the break to the new topics.

  <P class=patSolution>
  Therefore, after each break, briefly review the topics that were covered before the break. Focus on the important aspects, try not to get lost in the details. Take this additional time into account when you create the schedule and the <A href="5.html">SEMINAR PLAN</A>.
  </P>
  <P class=patExample>
  There are different ways to accomplish this review. Either you simply repeat the important topics, or you quickly revisit the important transparencies, et cetera.  In a well-working group it is even better if one of the participants repeats the important topics perhaps by using your transparencies.
  </P>
  <P class=patExample>
  As always, it is  best if the participants are active instead of passive. Here, that means that the repetition can be achieved by letting every participant write down the important topics on a paper on his own, or by discussing the important topics with her neighbor. To simplify such a discussion, you can prepare cards with important topics. Another possibility is to ask questions and let the participants answer them, perhaps in groups.
