To improve their skills, the exercise must be located at the upper edge of the participant's current skill level. Because this is usually not the case, there are some participants who consider the exercises overly simple (and do not learn anything) and some, that consider the exercises too difficult (and are frustrated, because they do not get them done; they do not learn anything, either).\n  ",
