Stick to the planned break times. If it is not possible to have a break at the planned time, tell the participants about it and ask them to continue for another five or ten minutes. This shows that you did not forget the break. Breaks also help to improve the quality of the group by providing room for <i>[[PERSONAL COMMUNICATION]]</i>.\n  ",

Keep the breaks short, and keep them in the schedule. Be sure that they are long enough that people have a realistic chance to go to the toilet or smoke a cigarette without returning late! During these breaks, coffee and other drinks (tea, juices) could be served. You should consider planning more breaks in the afternoon, since people are usually more tired than in the morning. Longer breaks for (second) breakfast and lunch should be included, of course.\n  ",
