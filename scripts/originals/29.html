  <p class=patHeading>29. DIGESTIBLE PACKETS *</p>

  <P class=patProblem>
  People can only concentrate for a limited period of time. This is the primary reason to include regular <A HREF="8.html">BREAKS</A>. If a topic takes longer than the time people can concentrate, the participants will have difficulties understanding the topic in its entirety. Because comprehension decreases, the motivation will decrease, too, and the seminar will be considered difficult.

  <P class=patSolution>
  Therefore, organize the topics in such a way, that the topics remain small and understandable. Ideally, each topic should be understandable on its own and should be finished during a reasonable amount of time, ideally the time the participants are able to concentrate. If the topic takes longer, make a break! Be sure to <A href="10.html">REVIEW AFTER BREAKS</A> to bring them back in line. Create logically consistent packets and show the interrelations among the packets.
  </P>
  <P class=patExample>
  Be sure that at the end of each session (or at least of each day) the topic is finished, usable, and complete. The participants will leave with a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction. You can use a <A href="11.html">SUMMARY</A> to augment this feeling. As a consequence, you should also avoid to organize a seminar that only covers "dry, unimportant" theory for the first three days, until at the fourth day, practically usable topics are taught. After at most two days, the participants will be disappointed and frustrated
