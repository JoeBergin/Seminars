  <p class=patHeading>16. NAMEPLATE *</p>

  <P class=patProblem>
  If you want to create a good atmosphere and facilitate <A href="14.html">PERSONAL COMMUNICATION</A>, you should give the participants and you a way to call everybody else by name.

  <P class=patSolution>
  Therefore, be sure that everybody wears a nameplate on his shirt, so that everybody's name is present all the time. Nameplates on the table are not suitable, because during breaks and other informal times when the names are most important, they are not available. Be sure to find a consensus whether to use first or last names.
  </P>
  <P class=patExample>
  An ideal and simple way to create nameplates is to use Tesa Krepp (a German brand of adhesive tape usually used for nameplates) and write the name on it with a thick pen.
