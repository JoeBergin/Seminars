  <p class=patHeading>1. CHECK PREREQUISITES **</p>

  <P class=patProblem>
  Preparing a seminar involves understanding a wide variety of issues and concerns. Each seminar has a unique audience with unique skills and objectives, and perhaps a different number of participants. It is usually held in a different place with a different infrastructure. Two seminars are never identical, even if they cover the same topic. You don't want to be surprised when you arrive on site and meet the participants.

  Therefore, check the prerequisites before creating a detailed <A href="5.html">SEMINAR PLAN</A>. Make sure that everything you rely on is really what you expect it. Use a checklist of all the necessary items before you start to plan the seminar in detail.
