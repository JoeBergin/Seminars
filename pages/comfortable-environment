Of course, often it is not possible to modify the room to suit your needs, but it may be possible to make it better at least.\n  ",

A wardrobe for the participants to put their jacket and bags is also a good idea. A very important aspect of the comfortable environment is <i>[[TABLE ARRANGEMENT]]</i>.\n  ",

If you need lighting regularly, be sure not to use neon lamps because they create a very artificial kind of light. Use pleasant lighting. Consider placing some plants in the room. Do not make the room look like a hospital by using white walls, white tables, et cetera. Use wood or other friendly material, and add curtains to the windows. Also take care of the infrastructure. Make sure that there are enough power outlets, also for the students. The same is true for LAN plug sockets, if computers will be used. A good projection surface for the overhead projector or beamer is also important, it should be large enough that the contents can be read from the back of the room.\n  ",
