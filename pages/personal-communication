They need to talk to each other informally. This is especially true if they work in the same domain and come from different companies, because they will want to talk shop with each other. If you do not give them the time explicitly, they will do it during the sessions. It is also very important that there are times where the distinction between you and the participants becomes less important. Informal talking is also necessary to build up a harmonious group.\n  ",

Avoid doing other things during this time, such as organizing the next sessions or making additional copies. Also try to avoid talking about the seminar or about topics from the seminar.\n  ",
